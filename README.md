# Installation
Copy files to local storage. If you get an error when extracting that the filenames are too big, download the file as a zip file and extract using 7zip.
Executing the command:
### npm install
And then following with the command:
### npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

# Design Process
First decision was to decide on what the target audience would be when using the digital interface. Based on the content it looked like the target audience were students and employers. So the interface needed to be modern so students can get used to it easier and professional so employers can take it seriously as a platform.  Material Design is a design approach created by Google and used on their platforms. To keep with the modern designs, I used Material Design for a lot of the elements so users would understand what are action possibilities.

Second I used Adobe XD to draw prototypes of the Web Design to make the implementation much easier. When implementing this project using React there are certain aspects of the initial prototype that were changed, like the explore page. In the Prototype I had it so the items where horizontally scroll-able but  when implementing noticed it didn't follow the design patterns I set in place on the other pages and changed it accordingly.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
